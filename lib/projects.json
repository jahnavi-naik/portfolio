I started by making a random inference function that would randomly choose the next letter to guess as a benchmark. I then created a function using bayesian inference, that was able to score an 93.8% accuracy after playing 1000 games."

I created a Random Forest Classification mode, and used Grid Search CV to determine the best hyperparameters for the model. After trying many different combinations of variables, I was able to create a model with an F-1 score of 0.91."

To do this, I first found a dataset from Kaggle containing statistics about the Disney Plus streaming service. I then cleaned the data and created different visualizations about the trends. This is my first project in Tableu, so it really allowed me to play with the different features and familiarize myself with all that it can do. It made me really understand the data and what is was telling me in order to create visualizations."

We found the dataset through the UCI repository, cleaned the data, created visualizations to display different aspects of the data, and ran a K Nearest Neighbors Analysis, yeilding a model with 66% accuracy. All work was done using Python though Jupyter Notebook. Thorugh this project, I got real experience collaborating with my group members and splitting up the work in an effecient way. I learned the importance of constant communication to successfully complete the project"

I used the given training set to train my Decision Trees model, selecting my features using the select best k algorithm, and then used that model on the test set, obtaining an accuracy score of 78%. I did this work using Python using a Jupyter notebook, and later uploaded it to Kaggle. This project allowed my to expand my knowledge on various maching learning models, as I had never used the decidion trees model previously. It gave me lots of practice on cleaning and transforming the data on order for it to be used for the model, and gave me practice in python in general. "
