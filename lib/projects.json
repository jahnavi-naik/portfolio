After trying many different combinations of variables, I was able to create a model with an F-1 score of 0.91.",

It made me really understand the data and what is was telling me in order to create visualizations.",

I used the given training set to train my Decision Trees model, selecting my features using the select best k algorithm, and then used that model on the test set, obtaining an accuracy score of 78%. I did this work using Python using a Jupyter notebook, and later uploaded it to Kaggle. This project allowed my to expand my knowledge on various maching learning models, as I had never used the decidion trees model previously. It gave me lots of practice on cleaning and transforming the data on order for it to be used for the model, and gave me practice in python in general.",
